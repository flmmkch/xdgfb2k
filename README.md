# xdgfb2k: XDG desktop files for Foobar2000

This set of files enable Linux desktop integration for the Foobar2000 audio player and library manager.

How to use it:
- Copy the repository's files (with their respective sub-paths) into `~/.local/`.
- Do a portable Foobar2000 installation into `~/.local/share/foobar2000`.
- You can now start Foobar2000 from the system menu and associate music files with it.

## Wine setup

**xdgfb2k** now uses its own custom Wineprefix `~/.local/share/foobar2000/wineprefix`.
